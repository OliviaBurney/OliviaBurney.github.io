<h1>My favourite hobbies</h1>
When I'm not working, you'll find me doing one of these things: 
<ul>
    <li>Skiing</li>
    <li>Hiking</li>
    <li>Doing yoga</li>
    <li>Journalling</li>
    <li>Playing board games</li>
</ul>
<h2> Skiing</h2>

<p><img class="floatright" src=images/babysnow.jpg>I have been skiing since I was a toddler and have spent many happy weeks skiing with family during my lifetime. Usually we will go to France to ski, as it is the closest. I have also done a ocuple of ski seasons alone. The first was in La Rosiere, when I was 18, then second in Meribel when I was 23.</p>
<p>I am also able to snowboard - to an extent - however, I defintely am better at skiing and prefer it for travellign around the mountain. My brother meanwhile much prefers snowboarding, as it allows him to tackle jumps better at the snow park and in general looks "cooler".</p>
<p><h2>Hiking</h2></p>
<p>I was lucky enough to grow up in the countryside, surrounded by fields, hills and woods, so I grew up going for walks in the surrounding area. After all, there wasn't much else to do. These days, now that I spend much more time in the city, I find that I miss the greenery when I don't see it for a couple of weeks and have to make sure that I go for regular hikes in the countryside, or even in big parks.</p>
<p>For a long time, I preferred running to walking, but I'm not convinced it is great for your joints when you do it alot and I prefer the relaxing side of walking or hiking. It also allows you to appreciated the environment alot more than if you are just racing to complete your 5km run.</p>
<h2>Yoga</h2>
<p>Yoga is a very recent hobby of mine. Although I have done it on and off for a couple of years, it was onlyin Deceember 2020, that I made a pledge to myself to do it every day for a month. Getting on for three months later and I am still enjoying it a lot.</p>
<p>It is certainly easier to do yoga in a class enviroment - either via Zoom or in person - or by following a video, such as those on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene" target="_blank">Yoga With Adriene YouTube channel</a>, but I am challenging myself to get more comfortable practicing without a guide and listening to my breath and body instead.</p>

<h2>Journalling</h2>
<p><img class="floatright" src=images/journal.jpg> People keep jounrals for various different reasons. I use it as a way to be creative, to remember things and a place that I can express my emotions.</p>
<p>I have been keeping a journal for almost three years now and have found it an incredibly rewarding tool. When I am upset or angry I can see that these emotions won't last forever and it allows me to look back on happy memories too. I really think that everyone should keep one </p>
<h2>Board Games</h2>
<p>I know, I know, traditionally board games aren't very cool, but there is something I love about the "old-fashioned" aspect of sitting around a board with the people I love and challenging them to use their logic and skills.</p>
<p>It is really hard to decide on which are my favourite games overall, however these are some of them:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a class="links"href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic" target="_blank">Pandemic</a> - Ironic right now I know</li>
    <li>Backgammon - I only learned how to play this year, but love it</li>
    <li>Scrabble - a great mental challenge</li>
    <li>Cluedo - a favourite of mine since childhood</li>
    <li>Rummikub - If you haven't played this, you must.</li>
</ul>
