    <h1>The Alps and Covid-19</h1>
    <p>As of January 20, 2021, it is not possible to alpine ski in the Alps in France due to the ongoing coronavirus situation. The government have said that it is even <strong> "very unlikley"</strong> that the resorts will open for the French school holidays in February and have called the season "une saison blanche". This is because the rates of infection have not reduced significantly to make it safe to run the lifts.</p>

    <p>However, it is still possible to enjoy the mountain air this winter, with some other outdoor pursuits, which do not involve the lifts.</p>
